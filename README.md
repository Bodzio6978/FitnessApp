# FitnessApp

## About

This project was created to help me in my fitness journey. It contains different modules such as:

- Calories and nutrition module, in a form of a journal when user can add already existing products or add their own product
- Weight tracking module, which is responsible for showing weight progress of the user and storing weight entered by the user
- User body measurement module, which is responsible for showing users their progress and storing their measurements

It also uses firebase authentication to authenticate users.
