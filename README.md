# FitnessApp

## About

This project was created to help me in my fitness journey. It contains differend modules such as:

- Calories and nutrition module in a form of a journal when user can add already existing products or add their own product
- Weight tracking module which is responsible for showing weight progress to user and storing weight entered by user
- User body measurement module which is responsible for showing users their progress and storing their measurements

It also uses firebase authentication to authenticate users.

## Technologies used

- Kotlin
- Firebase
- Coroutines
- Dagger Hilt
- ROOM

## Features planned for the future

- Adds
- Charts for weight and body measurements
- Data caching(Making more use of ROOM that firebase)
- User customization(app colors, starting screen etc)

## Installation

You can clone this project to your Android Studio and then generate .apk file but you wonn't have necessary files for application to work properly. I may release this app to the google playstore soon.
